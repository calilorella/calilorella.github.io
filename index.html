		<h2 id=Who Am I?">Who Am I?</h2>
		
		<p>
		My name is <strong>Cali Erlichman.</strong> I am 14 years old and my birthday is October 23rd, 2010.<br>
		I have a sister named <strong>Quinn</strong> and she is 12 years old. I also have a cute goldendoodle<br>
		named <strong>Lola.</strong> I would say I am more of an <em>introverted</em> person but I really like<br>
		having friends and hanging out with them on weekends and after school. 
		</p>

		<h2>Would I Rather...</h2>
		
		<h3>Would I rather be able to fly or be invisible</h3>

		<p>
		Well, I definitely think I would be able to get places faster with flight,<br>
		however, I think I would rather have the ability to be invisible. I think I<br>
		would choose this because just imagine being able to listen to people’s conversations<br>
		without them knowing you’re actually there. I feel like I would be able to learn a lot<br>
		by being invisible. I also think it could <em>really</em> come in handy in many situations.<br>
		Say I’m being chased by a serial killer and I need to disappear, I could literally<br>
		just become invisible and disappear in thin air. So overall, I would rather have the power<br>
		of <strong>invisibility</strong> over the power of flight.
