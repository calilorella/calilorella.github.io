						<h3><li>Why Does Paris See This Temperature and Precipitation?</li></h3>
						<p>
							Paris experiences a temperate maritime climate due to many factors including its latitude, ocean currents, and air currents.<br>
							<strong>Factor 1:</strong><br>
							Paris does have seasonal changes due to having a latitude of 48.8567°N, with cool/cold winters and warm summers with average highs anywhere from 7°C in January to 25°C in July and August.<br>
							<strong>Factor 2:</strong><br>
							The ocean current North Atlantic Drift, flows out of the Gulf Stream, and plays a big role in warming the air masses in Western Europe, which makes the winters in Paris less intense than in other areas of the same latitude.<br>
							<strong>Factor 3:</strong><br>
							The westerly winds also cause moisture in the air that is carried by the Atlantic Ocean which then  causes regular rainfall throughout the year (around 50-77 mm per month) and not much snowfall.<br>
							<br>
							These are the factors that explain why the temperature and precipitation data in my table is seen in Paris.
						</p>		

						<h3><li>Typical Vegetation and Fauna Found in Paris</li></h3>
						<p>
							The typical vegetation of Paris is a mix of a mix of planted ornamental trees which include plane trees, horse chestnuts, lindens and maples, and more. Within more managed gardens like the Jardin des Plantes, thousands of plant species are planted, whereas less managed spaces such as sidewalk edges or other random spots have vegetation that include grasses and weeds and native plants like most cities would normally have. Examples of these wildlife habitats include green spaces such as the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. Some of the most common fauna include birds (pigeons, ducks), smaller mammals, like red foxes, hedgehogs, and a few different bat species. The city has ponds and canals where aquatic life can also be found. In general, Paris contains almost 2,800-2,900 species of wild organisms, which is quite a surprising biodiversity considering Paris is an urban ecosystem.
						</p>	

						<h3><li>Climate Change Challenges Paris is Facing</li></h3>	
						<p>
							There are quite a few big climate change challenges Paris is experiencing. These challenges include an increase in heatwaves and floods, water shortage, and infrastructure and public health stress. Increasing global temperatures and the urban heat island effect are making summers even hotter which can be dangerous to the health of Parisians and is also consuming more energy. The heavy rainfall has been increasing and becoming more intense causing areas that are generally lower to the ground or just may be lower than other parts of Paris, to flood and that is causing damage to infrastructure. Meanwhile, Paris is also having longer dry periods and an increase in the evaporation which is threatening water availability and puts trees, green areas and garden spaces at risk. Without enough water, this wildlife will struggle to survive. All of these challenges are all mainly caused by global warming, changing weather patterns, and having many people as well as buildings jammed into small areas. There are many vulnerable people in these areas who have higher health risks, have poor income or living conditions and this means they might suffer more than others.
